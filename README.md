# distributed-sensor-fusion
### An educational repository about Sensor Data Processing and Information Fusion

*NOTE:* This repository currently only includes a central Kalman Filter, but a distributed implementation will soon come. 

In general, we try to keep the code as modular as possible, to ensure that it is easy to add new test cases. The current simulation shows a set of airplanes flying on a predefined trajectory. A set of sensors register these objects and send these noisy polar measurements to the agent, which performs the sensor fusion. This framework gives a lot of freedom to play around with Kalman Filtering, thus I encourage you to just try it out!
